# minesweeper - developed by Nell junior

This project was made in response to the challenge proposed by the company Deviget. The idea was to create an online game that would be hosted by Heroku: Cloud Application Platform and could have an interaction created with phyton/flask technology.


# Rule 

The rule of the game is simple, the number on a block shows the number of mines adjacent to it and you have to flag all the mines.


# Settings

if you wish, you can change parameters such as number of bombs, rows and columns, click on the button symbolized by a gear located at the top and right of the page
